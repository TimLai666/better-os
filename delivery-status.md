# Delivery Status

## Current Phase

Initial monorepo foundation and release packaging contract

## Stage Objective

Make the component contract and non-privileged manager planning path verifiable
before adding real system integration.

## Active Workstreams

- Shared manifest schema and validation
- Manager dry-run planning and CLI
- Monitor observation contracts
- Release packaging contract and clean-install verification plan

## Milestones

| id | target | owner | status | verification_signal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1 | workspace and shared contracts | agent | done | `cargo test -p better-core` |
| M2 | manager dry-run path | agent | done | CLI list/status/plan output |
| M3 | monitor and GUI shells | agent | done | `cargo build --workspace`; both GUI binaries stayed alive for 8 seconds in a Wayland session |
| M4 | docs and CI | agent | done | workflow file and docs review |
| M5 | release packaging contract | agent | done | `docs/release-packaging.md` and ticket 06 acceptance criteria |
| M6 | target-compatible `.deb` packaging | agent | done | GitHub Actions Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 amd64 and native arm64 matrix build, dependency metadata check, checksum verification |

## Current Blockers

No active blocker remains for the GUI smoke test or the target-compatible
Ubuntu package matrix. The target-specific asset naming and manifest mapping
decision is now recorded in ADR 0002 and merged into `main`.
Ticket 06 still needs formal release assets, real manifest checksum verification,
an approved maintainer contact, and the root project license before publishing.

## Next Verifiable Output

With this contract change merged, create the combined version Release,
replace placeholder checksums with the published sidecar values, and verify all
manifest variants against their target-specific assets.

## Decision Log

- decision: use a Rust workspace with separate core, CLI, GUI, and monitor crates
  rationale: preserve non-privileged and presentation boundaries from issue #1
  timestamp: 2026-07-31
  impacted_ticket_ids: [01, 02, 03]
- decision: keep `RUST_FONTCONFIG_DLOPEN=1` in local and CI checks, and install
  X11/Wayland development libraries in CI
  rationale: GPUI's current Linux backend links fontconfig, XCB, and xkbcommon;
  the project should expose that prerequisite instead of hiding a failed GUI link
  timestamp: 2026-07-31
  impacted_ticket_ids: [04, 05]
- decision: use GitHub repository sources for GPUI and gpui-component during the
  scaffold because the upstream README documents that integration path
  rationale: GPUI is pre-1.0 and the current component README uses repository
  dependencies
  timestamp: 2026-07-31
  impacted_ticket_ids: [04]
- decision: keep GPUI `*-dev` packages in the build environment and declare only
  verified runtime libraries in each release `.deb`
  rationale: release users should install through local APT without setting up a
  compiler/linker environment; package metadata is the correct dependency
  boundary
  timestamp: 2026-07-31
  impacted_ticket_ids: [06]
- decision: run arm64 release packaging on native GitHub-hosted arm64 runners
  rationale: the component manifests declare amd64 and arm64 support, and native
  runners avoid QEMU emulation while preserving one compatible build environment
  per Ubuntu release and architecture
  timestamp: 2026-07-31
  impacted_ticket_ids: [06]
- decision: use one version Release with target-specific package assets and
  schema v2 artifact variants keyed by Ubuntu release and architecture
  rationale: avoid filename collisions across the four package jobs and let
  every manifest checksum map to exactly one published package
  timestamp: 2026-07-31

## Handoff Notes

The checkout started with only `README.md`. Rust is available through
`/home/tim/.cargo/bin`, but is not on the default shell `PATH`.

The four-entry Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 amd64 and native arm64 package matrix passed
in PR #11, including the native `dpkg`/`uname` checks, package build, runtime
dependency checks, checksums, and artifact upload. Clean Ubuntu containers for
all four target/architecture pairs installed the downloaded artifacts with APT,
had no `*-dev` packages, resolved all dynamic libraries, and passed checksum
verification. Both GUI binaries stayed alive in GPUI headless mode.
The post-merge `main` CI run 30638535908 passed Rust checks and all four package
jobs. PR #12 is merged into `main` at `000d2e5`; the release artifact mapping
decision is recorded in ADR 0002, and `main` validates schema v2 manifests and
emits target-specific package filenames.
The package payload also started both GUI binaries for 12 seconds in the host's
Zorin OS 18.1 GNOME Wayland session with `ZED_HEADLESS` unset. Docker's Xvfb and
host-socket tests still failed because they did not provide a usable compositor,
but the direct host session passed. No public release asset exists yet, and
manifest checksum values, maintainer approval, and the root project license
remain open.
PR #9 is merged into `main` at `fb3520f`. PR #12's feature branch has been
deleted from both the local checkout and GitHub.
